HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2:


HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol and it is used to communicate between client and server.

* HTTP 1.1

        When the request made to the server, server responds from source. Before this response a TCP connection is made between client and server
    the communication will be not lost after the first time request. The connection has several requests and response in single connection.
        All the request and responses are in text format.
        Head of line blocking the connection and all other request until the response recieved.
        All the information related to the header file repeated in all the request.
    These are major drawbacks of HTTP1.1

* HTTP 2

        HTTP2 works on the binary frame instead of textual format 
        It is multiplexed with connection on multiple request
        The server sends all files without request of client using PUSH frame.



Obejects in Java script:

        Objects are used to store the keyed collections of various data.
        Objects can be created using different forms.
        Objects can be accessed through two methods 
            Dot notation
            Bracket notation
        We can add or delete properties within the object.
        looping can be done through the object.
